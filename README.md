# <h1>bug-finder :bug:</h1>
This code prints the number of bug occurrences in a test file
# <h3>Description:</h3>
<p>This code basically reads a ‘bug' text file and a ‘test' text file and then it determines how many times the bug is inside the test file. The empty spaces of the bug are not part of its pattern, so it could eventually find the bug in a "noisy" background.</p>
<p>The bug is drawn in ASCII – style and can be found within bug.txt. The code searches inside the test file for bugs and print the number of their occurrence. <p>
